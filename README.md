# MachineLearning
Machine learning projects using Python, R, mySQL
-  Analyze our data using logistic regression, random forest, and deep learning methods in scikit-learn Gradient Boosting, Naiyes Bayes, and Neural Net in Keras API.
- Use StratifiedKFold cross-validation to create multiple train/test data sets for training and testing the model.
- Train and fit the models on our loaded data by calling the fit() function on the model. We explore different parameters to find the combination that performs best. To validate the models, we use the test data and the predict() function. 
- Perform 
- Compare the results of our models with the actual results in the test data. The effectiveness of the algorithms of the prediction are measured using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, precision, and f-measure tests as below. The models are compared using ROC for overall performance.
- Perform Hyperparameter Tuning and Grid Search for  Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression models.
