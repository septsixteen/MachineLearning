# MachineLearning
Machine learning projects using Python, R, mySQL
- Mine and process data in the web
-  Analyze our data sets using various machine learning algorithms in Python and R: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naiyes Bayes, Clustering, Classification, and deep learning methods in scikit-learn Neural Net in Keras API.
- Use various cross-validation methods to create multiple train/test data sets for training and testing the models.
- Perform variable Selections such as PCA, LDA, weights. 
- Train, fit, and validate the models. 
- Explore different parameters to find the combination that performs best using Grid Search CV. 
- The effectiveness of the algorithms of the prediction are measured using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, precision, and f-measure tests as below. The models are compared using ROC for overall performance
